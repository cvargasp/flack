# Project 2

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

""" NOTE: To Run use 'python application.py' instead of 'flask run' if you intend to debug it or normally too """

This is my CS50W's Project 2 : Flack

List of files:
    favicon.ico: icon to be displayed with title of the webpage
    index.js: contains the client-side elements of the application.
    styles.css: custom cascading style sheet.
    index.html: contains HTML used for the main/single page of the application (extends layout.html).
    layout.html: contains the general layout or blueprint of web page.
    application.py: contains the server-side elements of the application (Python, Flask, Flask-Socketio).
    requirements.txt: contains required Python libraries for the program.

Personal Touch:
    Change name: I've added an option to change the unique "Display Name".
    Status: When a user joins/leaves a channel, other users on that channel are notified about it.
